<h1>
Clone of Youtube
</h1>

<p>

YouTube is a video sharing service where users can watch, like, share, 
comment and upload their own videos. The video service can be accessed on PCs, laptops, tablets and via mobile phones.
</p>

For creating this youtube clone I have used Youtube Api to fetch the  data from youtube.

User can search their desired video that they want to see. I have given Search functionality here.
After search user can see the reated results of 25 videos.

User can click one of the video and then user can redirect to the another page and on that page user can watch their video.
